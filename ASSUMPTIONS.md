# Assumptions & Limitations

- **Assumption:** All transactions with a valid CustomerID are final sales. Product returns are not explicitly accounted for beyond removing cancelled orders.
- **Limitation:** The dataset is a small, representative sample. Insights are for demonstration purposes and may not reflect the full scope of the original data.
- **Limitation:** The analysis does not include customer acquisition cost (CAC) or product costs, so true profitability cannot be calculated.
